Proposal
========
gameplay:
---------
the goal of the player(s) is to survive until daylight in every stage, the player will have either a sword or a gun as weapon to defeat the zombies. Zombies will spawn at random places and will always walk toward the player or the citizens. The citizens will not do anything but walk in random direction. The citizens will change into zombies after being attacked. 

user story:
-----------
player one will have **WASD** to control direction    
player two will have **arrow keys** to control directon  
whoever wields the gun will have the mouse to aim , fire, and turn directions and whoever wields the sword can only turn with direction input and attack with **spacebar**
